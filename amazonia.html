            <p>Butterflies, flowers, and hearts. These adornments found in old teen magazines can also be easily identified on pepper spray packaging. With advertisements promising self-protection for women, these products are sold in pink packaging, vibrant colors, and even imitations of makeup products.</p>
            <p>This is what an analysis conducted using data from pepper spray ads on the Mercado Livre website on July 5th of this year shows. Python programming language was used to collect and analyze all the listings on the website that advertised the sale of pepper sprays. The code and analysis are available <a href="https://github.com/juditecypreste/pepper-pink-spray">here</a>.</p>
            <p>A success among Brazilians, Mercado Livre is the largest e-commerce website used in the country, surpassing even Amazon. According to SimilarWeb, a website and app analysis tool, Mercado Livre achieved a total of 236 million visits, compared to Amazon's 169 million.</p>
            <p>In total, 460 listings advertising the product were collected, with an average price of R$ 157 or U$32, according to the exchange rate of the day. Among pepper sprays and ginger sprays, around 54 products advertised their sale as "exclusive" to women.</p>

        <p>In addition to stereotypical elements about femininity, some sellers made it clear in the titles of their listings that the products aimed to ensure women's safety in some way. "Ginger Personal Defense Spray for Feminine Self-Defense" and "40ml Pepper Spray Personal Defense Protection for Women!!!" were some of the titles of the found ads.</p>
        <p>Other products were also found that, outside of this list, maintain a clear message that the product is sold only for a specific gender. Without explicit mentions of women in the title, the ads showcased eye-catching images targeted at this audience.</p>
        <p>These same ads put women's protection at stake, as they could still have doubts about purchasing the product. Messages questioned whether the buyer was certain they preferred to remain unprotected without the spray or to guarantee their own life by acquiring the product.</p>
